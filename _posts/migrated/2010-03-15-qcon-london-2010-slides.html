Some of the slides for these are <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2010/schedule/wednesday.jsp">available online</a> on the official QCon London website. Although, the slides by themselves do not ever match for going there yourself, these and the blogs are good for those who could not attend it.<div class="blogger-post-footer">- Thomas Joseph</div>
