Now the slides of the sessions at JavaOne 2009 are out and available at <a href="http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/index.jsp">Sun Developer Network (SDN)</a>.
<br/><br/>
You need to be a registered user there! (For some, this sucks!)
<br/><br/>
Modularity and OSGi was one of the discussed topics in the sessions, but worried to find that Sun has not mentioned anything on it (OSGi) on the site, though it has put up the slides :).
<br/><br/>
<h3>More Goodies</h3>
Sun has put up some good articles and other stuffs on JavaOne as well on its <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/2009/articles/listing.jsp">site</a>.
