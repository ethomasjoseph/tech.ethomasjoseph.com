I had just brought a new headphone for making Skype calls. I was trying testing it out, and I recorded my voice to test it. What came in was a movie song that I was chanting over. I played it back to find too much of background noise. I wanted to remove it. Now for any utility for my OS, I do not rely on a search engine,.. I rely on my "<i>Synaptic Package Manager</i>" on my Linux box - <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 9.10 (Karmic Koala). Quick was it, to get "<i>Audacity</i>" to help me record, and edit audio. <br />

Notice, that I split the audio into multiple tracks easily and mix it at proper timings.<br />

Believe me. Within half an hour I could learn the basic stuff and the edited voice was so good to hear now. I thought, how about mixing some music as well? Soon I got the Karaoke for it as well. Without much practice or effort, I could record that song with the music tack mixed. Hear it to believe it! <br />

This is a romantic song "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mbiy4DXHPq0">Pathira Pullu</a>" from the Malayalam Movie - "<a href="http://www.moserbaerhomevideo.com/title-view.htm?titleid=3399">Ee Puzhayum Kadannu</a>"(1996). It is one of my favorites songs. Music composed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_%28composer%29">Johnson</a> (one of my favorite music composers), and originally sung by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._J._Yesudas">KJ Yesudas</a> (obviously my favorite singer). <br />

Those who know me personally can recognize my voice. I have just removed some background noise, added some echo and bass. I am just a bathroom singer, but the voice seems to come out pretty well after the treatment. Even as a fist-time sound recordists, the result was pleasing to me, even with the low quality of the microphone and the always present background noise. <br />
<br />
I would encourage people to try this out. Linux is not just for geeks. <u>Linux is for <b>all</b> human beings</u>. I am sure there should be more professional tools available for professional people. You can at-least use the tool to record your voice at home and send to participate in your favorite music reality shows :). <br />

<b>PS:</b> I would have preferred to upload flac/ogg format, but then my friends on non-Linux machines would have no way to hear it.</div>
