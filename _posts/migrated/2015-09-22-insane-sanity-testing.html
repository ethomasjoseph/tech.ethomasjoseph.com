You are busy writing your code on a complex piece and suddenly a team wide announcement comes - "<i>The new code has gone in for the build, please do '<b>sanity</b>' for your components</i>".<br />
<br />
"My unit tests would save me!" is not something which will save you here if this happens to be something which has a lot of visual and "content driven" elements. So, you break out of writing code half-way and start doing the "sanity" because it is crucial to test your components before lunch, as this code will be going to production soon after. You do this half-heartedly because this is so common for you whenever a major release happens or a content restructuring happens - and anyway "I am not a tester!". So you lose at-least one hour of your otherwise productive time to doing this insanely mundane task. On top of this, you also have your "professional testers" doing the same testing -just few extra eyeballs! This is the typical scenario if you are developing content driven (CMS) applications. Bless you if you are not so!</div>

At this age in Digital Marketing, where <a href="http://www.marketingdonut.co.uk/marketing/marketing-strategy/why-content-is-king-in-today-s-marketing" target="_blank">content is the king</a>, faster development and delivery overpowers the more structured delivery methods often followed in typical enterprise applications, where you invest for a lot of integrated and automated testing. Reason - "If we invest time to build integration testing and automation, we lose time to market". This is a broken argument often upheld by people who most often do not even care about<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html" target="_blank"> integration testing</a>&nbsp;in its real sense, and automated testing which can test the UI elements and the content of the page.<br />
<br />
If we can invest some time in bringing about continuous integration and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GUI_testing_tools" target="_blank">UI automation</a>, a lot - <i>really lot</i> of time could be saved on developers doing "<i>sanity testing</i>". This may be difficult to achieve for shorter duration projects of the span less than 6 months - all out of their own budget, but may be easily feasible for bigger projects. Better - if this could be planned by "practice leads" who could invest on this once, and reap the benefits multiple times across projects. I do not have metrics to prove this by maths, but just a little retrospection into this would be useful.</div>

Personally, this topic is lower on my radar. First, there are higher priority tasks for learning and experimentation on my TODO list. Second, I work more in a consulting mode than delivery, so budgeting it on &nbsp;my project is not possible. Additionally, I do not have metrics to convince my client to budget this either! However, I will <i>try </i>to squeeze in some time in the coming days and weeks to do some research into this topics and publish my findings.</div>
