Today I happened to see a TV advertisement which had a beautiful story - "Nice is just ordinary!". This happened to &nbsp;rephrase what <a href="http://chadfowler.com/" target="_blank">Chad Fowler</a> had to say in his amazing book - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development/dp/1934356344#" target="_blank">The Passionate Programmer - Creating A REMARKABLE CAREER in software development (2009)</a>, which I had finished reading one round just today.<br />

<i>Winning is not about not-losing. Winning is about being awesome. Winning is about being Amazing - Remarkable!</i><br />

My career, as I look back, seemed to have stagnated. I never had a roller-coaster ride in my career. I had pigeon-holed myself into the mediocrity - especially for the last 4-5 years. No one else to be blamed - just me. This was why I forced myself to read this excellent book to be inspired, and bring out the best in me. After-all I got into this profession for pure passion.<br />
<br />
This book was in my reading list ever since 2010, but it was two weeks back that I finally ordered a paperback edition from Amazon, which I would religiously read during my travel to and from office.<br />

The world around us always demands extra-ordinary and amazing things. Everything else is just OK, and CAN just live without. But I would like my life to be something which would create a dent in the world! Something awesome; something remarkable!<br />
<br />
Yes, I do need a lot of overhauling. I have to invest in myself - to be a remarkable product - to create remarkable products. And this should mark the beginning of the journey to a remarkable career.<br />
<br />
Over the next course of time, I would post critique to the book, apart from my brain dumps of some interesting ideas brewing.</div>
