<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I have often come across this requirement across multiple projects, where we need to write a method, which can potentially return object of any class, and still you would not like to do a typecasting. Something like this:<br />
<pre class="brush: java">MyClass myClass = getDynamicClass(MyClass.class);
</pre><br />
Instead of :<br />
<pre class="brush: java">MyClass myClass = (MyClass) getDynamicClass(MyClass.class);
</pre><br />
Common example of such use case is where you would do some lookup of a dynamic service (as in OSGi) and return the object found. However, with Java 5 and above this is easy. So, if your earlier code was:<br />
<pre class="brush: java">protected Object getDynamicClass(Class interfaceClass) {
    Object obj = null;
    // code to create / lookup the dynamic object
    return obj;
}
</pre>This code can be converted as follows:<br />
<pre class="brush: java">protected &lt;ReturnType&gt; ReturnType getDynamicClass(Class&lt;ReturnType&gt; interfaceClass) {
    Object obj = null;
    // code to create / lookup the dynamic object
    if (interfaceClass.isInstance(obj)) {
        return interfaceClass.cast(obj);
    }
    return null;
}
</pre>This is very obvious code, but thought that sharing this would be useful. Enjoy!</div><div class="blogger-post-footer">- Thomas Joseph</div>
