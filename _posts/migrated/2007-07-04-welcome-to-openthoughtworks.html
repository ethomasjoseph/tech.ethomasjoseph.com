Thanks for visiting my blog !
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Yet another blog ?</span><br/>
Well, this is something that time will tell, but I plan it to be something special (everybody says it!).
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">How will it be special ?</span><br/>
I don't want this blog to be something sort of my daily dairy where there would be everything scratched up in my mind, but rather, what I blog here would be planned and systematic. For the same reason, my blogs may be having good gap! Things would not be cooked up just for some abuse, or generating some revenue by ads (though I would be happy if you click on those ads if you find them useful), but they would be something useful, not only to other people, but also to me in the future, where I can trace back my thoughts.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">What will it contain ?</span><br/>
Mostly technical articles. Since I am a software professional, things will be moved that way. Also I am an Free/Open Source (FOSS) promoter - my articles will indicate it. Being a Java guy, my articles may be more leaned towards that, though wherever possible, I will try to be as neutral as possible.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Not just technical stuffs, I will also try to cover some HR related topics, some career pointers etc. Of-course like any other blog, I will try to include some of my personal experiences in every blog that I cover if needed/ appropriate.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Hope you will find this blog a great place.
